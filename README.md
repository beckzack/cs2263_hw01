### Usage
To use, you first must clone the repository to your local machine. 
Near the top of the page, there is a green "Code" button. Click on the drop down and copy the URL provided. Now, using the command line on your machine, use the git clone <URL> command, where <URL> is the URL you just copied from GitHub. Now, you can import the project to an IDE or run the main Java file from the command line. The program will then allow you to enter an expression and will evaluate and return the result of the expression evaluated from left to right. You may also choose to write the results to a specified file using the -o <file_name> flag from the command line or you can read prewritten expressions from a file using the -b <file_name> flag from the command line.
